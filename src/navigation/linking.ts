/**
 * Every screen has an address (the second half of "deep links per screen"): the tabs and the Studios by the web's own
 * paths, the other settings sections of the web on the Settings tab, and what only the phone has under `orazaka://`
 * (starting a run, the sign-in flow, a password-reset token). The universal links the app CLAIMS stay `app-links.json`'s:
 * the web serves that list and CI checks it against the web's routes.
 *
 * Universal links / App Links: the addresses `app-links.json` claims (the same file the web app serves its
 * apple-app-site-association and assetlinks from) open the screen that shows the same thing. `orazaka://` stays for
 * deep links of our own. A path with no screen here opens the app where it was.
