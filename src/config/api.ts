/**
 * @file api.ts
 * @description Resolves the edge base URL for the mobile client and carries its bearer token.
 *
 * The mobile app talks to the **edge** (:8088), not to the Next.js BFF. AGENTS.md §8 requires the
 * BFF for the *browser*, and for a good reason — a page must never learn a service port. A native
 * app is a different client: the BFF authenticates with a next-auth session **cookie**, which
 * React Native cannot obtain or carry, while the edge already speaks `Authorization: Bearer` and
 * exchanges API keys for JWTs (`ApiKeyExchangeFilter`). Routing the app through the BFF would have
 * meant inventing a second, native-only authentication path inside a component whose whole purpose
 * is to serve the browser.
 *
 * Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_EDGE_URL` to an address the device can reach (e.g. `http://192.168.1.5:8088`
 * for a physical device, or `http://10.0.2.2:8088` for the Android emulator). The `localhost`
 * fallback works for the iOS simulator, which shares the host network.
